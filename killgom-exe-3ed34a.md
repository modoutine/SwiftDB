KillGom.exe is a process associated with GOM Player, a popular media player developed by GOM & Company, specifically linked to the version 1.0.0.1 of the software. This executable file is responsible for terminating instances of the GOM Player when necessary, but it has drawn attention due to its potential classification as a virus or malware by some antivirus programs, which may flag it mistakenly due to its behavior of closing applications. While the file is not inherently harmful and is a legitimate component of GOM Player, users may encounter errors or warnings related to it, particularly if they have third-party security software that misidentifies it. To ensure safety, users should verify the file's origin and ensure they have downloaded GOM Player from the official website, as malicious versions of similar filenames exist that can pose a security risk.
